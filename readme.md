I originally intended to use Flask's blueprints on this project when I started it
in the Fall of 2018. However, I got busy with my classes and work and the project
was put on hold. When I came back to it, I ripped it apart and made it a project
using Vue. It's much smaller than I intended but I also have to say that I got a
little bored with the project. Saying that, I'm still fairly happy with how it
turned out. I also used Vuex throughout all of it so that's good news!
