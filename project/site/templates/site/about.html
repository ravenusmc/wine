      <p>Hi, my name is Mike Cuddy and I love building data science sites.
        Although I'm not a data scientist yet, I should soon be working towards
        starting a masters in Data Scientist. Over the past 2 to 2.5 years, I've
        built quite a few projects online focusing on looking at data. You'll be
        able to see some of them below. I have a background in history and
        political science so a lot of my projects tend to focus on social issues.
        Sometimes though, I like to look at other things such as UFO's! I hope
        you check out some of my videos and let me know what you think! 
    </p>
